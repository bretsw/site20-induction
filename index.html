# Induction

### Tension between two worlds about what and how to teach

# Induction

### Social media: From two worlds to many worlds

# Induction

### An edu-verse: 

many voices offering ideas about what and how to teach

# Purpose

### The purpose of this study is to explore:

--

* what supports for professional learning ECEs seek during induction, if any; 

--

* from whom; and 

--

* how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections.

# Professional Learning Networks

&lt;img src="img/network.jpg" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Review of Literature

---

# Teacher Induction

&lt;img src="img/workshop.jpg" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

1. Primarily formal induction programs

--

1. Induction challenges: everything new, still learning, identity development

--

1. Primarily local relationships

---

# Educatorsâ€™ Use of Social Media

&lt;img src="img/social-media.jpg" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

1. Primarily informal learning opportunities

--

1. General difficulty of teaching: tiring, specific ideas, professional isolation

--

1. Primarily global relationships

---

# Purpose

---

# Purpose

### Again, the purpose of this study is to explore:

--

* what supports for professional learning ECEs seek during induction, if any; 

--

* from whom; and 

--

* how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections.

&lt;img src="img/purpose.jpg" width="420px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Research Questions

&lt;img src="img/question.jpg" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

* RQ1. What **supports for professional learning**, if any, are ECEs seeking during induction?

--

* RQ2. What **reasons**, if any, do ECEs report for seeking induction supports, and what reasons do they give, if any, for not seeking induction supports?

--

* RQ3. What **interpersonal connections** do ECEs make when seeking supports for professional learning during induction?

--

* RQ4. How, if at all, do ECEs use **social media** as a modality to access supports for professional learning during induction?

# Themes

# "I gotta get this done"

&lt;img src="img/quote.jpg" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

*I was spending a lot of time staying at school, until six o'clock.* 

--

*Because I felt like, I gotta get this done, I gotta get that done.*

---

# "We need to just sit down"

&lt;img src="img/quote.jpg" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

*I told her at the beginning, I was like, I don't want to sit and talk about things really, for the most part. I might tell you like a five minute thing, but that's about it.*

--

*Okay, you're here for 30 minutes basically. We need to like really just sit down and do this because like, I don't know what I'm doing by myself.*

---

# "I know what I'm getting into"

&lt;img src="img/quote.jpg" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

*Like, I know what I'm getting myself into when I open each one of the apps, if that makes sense.*

---

# "It's for an outlet"

&lt;img src="img/quote.jpg" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

*A lot of times, if I go to social media, it's kind of for an outlet, for frustrations, and difficulties...*

--

*and just like the frustration of not getting the help, and having the crappy buildings...*

--

*I was recently sharing [on social media] how I have to keep my coat and bags and giant Ziploc baggies, I don't bring friends home.*

---

# "I feel like a crappy teacher"

&lt;img src="img/quote.jpg" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

*And you know, back to the Instagram thing, I do follow some teacher accounts...* 

--

*I'll follow them, and sometimes I feel like, it makes me feel like a crappy teacher.*

--

*And because like I'm seeing them do all these things. And I'm like, 'I'm tired right now. If I did all those things, I would either never sleep, or I would be just doing those things. I wouldn't be able to follow through with them and actually teach with those tools that they're spending hours making on the weekend.'*

--

*And it just, it makes me feel like I should be doing more. But I already feel like I'm doing more than I can keep up with.*

---

# "I am just the viewer"

&lt;img src="img/quote.jpg" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

*I, I wish, because my Instagram is very one-sided, like teachers are telling me things... I just don't add to it ever. I just am the viewer, I guess you could say.* 

--

*And so I kind of wish that I would have gotten more involved and communicated with more people to get more out of it.*

--

*I kind of felt like I was just kind of watching things go by. And if I would have maybe engaged more with it, I would have realized, kind of the resources that were out there. I don't know, that's a hard one.*

--

*But I think, just, I wish I would have started sooner and found resources that I felt like I might have needed that first at least half year.*

---

# "I'll contribute someday"

&lt;img src="img/quote.jpg" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

*So yeah, guilty, guilty admission on Pinterest, I'm a taker.* 

--

*But I think in the long scheme, I'll be a contributor. I keep saying, some of the things, I create a lot for my classes, and I do want to put them on TeachersPayTeachers. Probably donation-based, but I like the idea of free, to be honest with you. I also like capitalism, don't get me wrong. I like the idea that you can get paid if you want to for your good ideas.*

--

*But, I don't know, I don't have a problem with putting some of the things up that I have for free. That's going to be a goal of mine in the next few years, though, if I think I have some quality ideas, throw them up there.*

# Significance

---

# Implications for Practice

&lt;img src="img/learning.jpg" width="420" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

* *for new teachers*: discover professional learning that has been helpful (and unhelpful) for peers

--

* *for teacher educators*: remember the tensions and complications in the journey for new teachers

--

* *for policy*: deepen understanding of new teachers to help address teacher attrition and turnover

# Conclusion

# Under Construction

&lt;img src="img/construction.jpg" width="600px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**No major conclusions yet... this is still a work in progress!**
